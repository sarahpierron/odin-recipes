    <p>Easy Bread recipe  made with simple ingredients & detailed instructions showing how to make bread! Best homemade bread recipe for both beginners and expert bakers.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>2 cups warm water 110 degrees F/45 degrees C</li>
        <li>1/2 cup white sugar</li>
        <li>1 1/2 tablespoons active dry yeast</li>
        <li>1 1/2 teaspoons salt</li>
        <li>1/4 cup vegetable oil</li>
        <li>5-6 cups flour  You can use all-purpose flour OR bread flour!</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>In a large bowl, dissolve the 1 TBSP of the sugar in warm water and then stir in yeast. Allow to proof until yeast resembles a creamy foam, about 5 minutes.</li>
        <li>Mix remaining sugar, salt and oil into the yeast. Mix in flour one cup at a time. Dough should be tacky and clean the sides of the bowl save for a small part at the bottom. Too much flour added in yields a dry loaf of bread, so if you're worried you added too much, add a bit more hot water, until you get the correct consistency.</li>
        <li>Knead dough for 7 minutes. Place in a well oiled bowl, and turn dough to coat. Cover with a damp cloth. Allow to rise until doubled in bulk, about 1 hour.</li>
        <li>Punch dough down. Knead for 1 minute and divide in half. Shape into loaves and place into two greased 9x5 inch loaf pans. Allow to rise for 30 minutes, or until dough has risen 1 inch above pans.</li>
        <li>Bake at 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) for 30-40 minutes. Cool, brush with butter and enjoy!</li>
    </ol>
