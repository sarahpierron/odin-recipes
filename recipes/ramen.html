    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>In a large soup pot, combine the broth, 2 cups water, soy sauce, vinegar, tahini, miso, and chili oil. Add the dried mushrooms (if using), ginger, and garlic. Set over medium heat on the stove and bring to a simmer, reduce the heat to medium-low and simmer 20 minutes, until the broth is very fragrant.</li>
        <li>Remove and discard the mushrooms. Bring the soup to a boil over high heat. Stir in the noodles, kale or spinach, and cilantro. Let sit 5 minutes or until the noodles are soft.</li>
        <li>Meanwhile, make the mushrooms. Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F. On a baking sheet, combine the butter, mushrooms, shallots, sesame seeds, chili flakes, and a pinch of salt. Transfer to the oven and roast for 15 minutes, stirring halfway through cooking, until the mushrooms are golden. Switch the oven to broil, broil 1-2 minutes, until crisp. Watch closely.</li>
        <li>Ladle the soup into bowls and top with the crispy mushrooms, eggs, carrots, green onions, and additional chili oil. Enjoy!</li>
